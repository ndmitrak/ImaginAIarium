## How to Use ##
To run the Telegram bot, please follow the steps below:

Clone the repository or download the code.
Install the necessary Python packages by
running pip install -r requirements.txt command in the terminal.

Create a .env file and add the following line: BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token,
replacing your_bot_token with your
own Telegram bot token. This token can be obtained from the BotFather.

Open the imagine32.py file and update the admin_user_id variable
to the Telegram ID of the user that should have access to the /clear and /answers commands.

Run the bot by executing python imagine32.py command in the terminal.
Once the bot is running, it will listen for messages in any group
or chat it has been added to.

The user with the ID specified in the admin_user_id variable
will be able to use the /clear command to clear the list of messages,
and the /answers command to get a table with all the messages saved so far.

To save a message, the user should send a message in the format "number text",
where "number" is a digit between 1 and 4, and "text" is the text of the message.
The bot will then save the message and reply with a confirmation message.
